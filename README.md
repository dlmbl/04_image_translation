# Exercise 6: Image translation

This exercise is split into two parts: 
- Virtual staining with a regression approach using a UNet  [part_1](./part_1/)
- Virtual staining with an generative approach using a GAN [part_2](./part_2/)

Look into the directory for the part you will be working on (i.e `part_1` or `part_2`) for further installation and 'how to run' instructions.
